# 4.6 Batch model Deployment w/ Prefect
- Want to use Prefect to schedule script we made

- Install pipenv

## Modifying score.py
- Add @run function ride_duration_prediction()
	- run_date could be None because of Prefect
	- We will put our own parameter here
	- Say if Prefect runs are low in June 2022, we need to get data from May
- Need to use Prefect context for handling date
	- Get expected start time from context
- Handling getting May instead of June
- Move file names and model calls to this function

- Start Prefect Orion
- Set API config in Python terminal
- Run score.py and test Prefect

- Ideally, we want to upload the parquet to S3 rather than locally
	- Adjust `output_file` to do so
	- s3://.../taxi_type={taxi_type}/year={year:04d}/month={month:02d}/{run_id}.parquet
		- Add the 'year=' for readability
- Notice the input files are also in S3
	- `$ aws s3 ls s3://nyc-tlc` 
	- Can see the CSV and parquet directories
	- NOTE: '+' replaces the space for URLS, but within S3 you have to use a space within quotes
- Upload to S3 fails?
	- Install s3fs with pipenv
- Upload worked.

## Making Prefect flow
- Back to the script
- Turn the following into tasks
	- `apply_model()`
- To avoid filling up Prefect DB, save file location instead of whole file
- Move the creation of `df_results` to its own function and call it from `apply_model`
- Change prints to info logging
- Put the date comprehension in function `get_paths()` and call from `ride_duration_prediction`
- Test

- Copy Prefect DeploymentSpec and imports to bottom of script
- Adjust flow, name and parameters
	- flow_location='my_score.py'
	- name="ride_duration_prediction"
	-     parameters={
        		"taxi_type": "green",
        		"run_id": "cd0a53fdc9b74cae82cbcd0c1d4c6b77",
    		},
- Switch to CronSchedule
	- We want 0 3 2 * *
	- 3AM on every 2nd day of the month
- Configure storage
	- Use local storage
	- Need to run `prefect storage create`
		- Set local, choose mlops-zoomcamp/04-deployment/batch/tmp
	- `flow_storage="..."'
- Run it via `prefect deployment create my_score_deploy.py`
- Need work queue to test this
	- Set only ride_duration_prediction
- Set worker with `prefect agent start <queue_id>`

- Go to Deployments and hit run
	- Should fail because we don't have data for May
- Let's see if we can run it for some past data
	- We have data until March this year
	- Let's try running from Feb 2021 to March 2022

## Backfilling data
- Create file my_score_backfill.py
- import score, prefect flow, datetime, dateutil relativedelta
- Create @flow, ride_duration_prediction_backfill()
	- Get start date, `start_date = datetime(year=2021, month=3, day=1)`
	- Get end date, `end_date = datetime(year=2022, month=4, day=1)`
- Execute ride_duration_prediction() from score.py for each month
	- Set loop with start_date, and call function by adding `relativedelta(months=1)`
- Set if name main

- Run my_score_backfill.py
