# Web-services: Deploying Models with Flask and Docker
- Go back to Week 01 notebook
	- Eventually saved model as pickle file
- We will take this pickle file and put in Flask application
	- No MLflow or Prefect
	- Raw web-service
- Will connect MLflow later

## Start
- Will follow mlzoomcamp week 05
	- Took pickle file and deployed as web service
- MLzoomcamp will be good review for Flask/Docker

- See 04-deployment/web-service/README.md
	- Need to find version of scikit-learn from notebook
	- Run pip freeze to get version
		- I did with v1.1.1, lecture shows 1.0.2
	- `pipenv install scikit-learn==1.0.2 flask --python=3.9`
		- Pipenv should be able to find this in anaconda
	- Create virtual env for us

## predict.py
- Open model
- Create function prepare_features(pd.dataframe)
	- Create dict with the values of 
		- PU_DO
		- trip_distance
	  from the dataframe
- Create function predict(features dict)
	- Create X by transforming features with dictvect
	- predict with model and return
- Create function prediction_endpoint()
	- Add @app.route annotation as /predict as POST
	- Set ride as get_json, call prepare_features() then predict()
	- Create results dict and return as jsonify
- Set app = Flask('duration-prediction') before app.route
- Add if __name__ __main__ bit
	- Set it to localhost:9696

- Run this now in your terminal

## test.py
- import predict
- Create dummy ride dict
- print prediction

- Switch this to call the REST API
- import requests instead
- Call requests.post(url, json=ride) with the dummy ride dict
	- Set url to localhost:9696
- print repsponse json

- Fails - note we didnt hit /predict
- Now it works!

## Fixing Production server warning
- Using WSGI server - install gunicorn
- Flask is just for development purposes - need proper WSGI server for production
- Run `gunicorn --bind=0.0.0.0:9696 predict:app`
	- Test that test.py still works

- Note that requests is in base python but not web-service from pipenv
	- A complete environement would include this, but we do not need this in production
		- The server only needs Flask
	- So, install web-service as a development dependency, but not a production dependency
		- `pipenv install --dev requests`

## Dockerfile
- Create in the same directory
- FROM python:3.9-slim as image
	- Slim is fine, 3.9 major version is specific enough
- RUN pip install -U pip
- RUN pip install pipenv
- WORKDIR /app
- COPY [ "Pipfile", "Pipefile.lock", "./"]
- RUN pipenv install --system --deploy
	- Just install to system python as we are already in docker container
	- --deploy makes sure the packages are properly locked in Pipfile.lock and locks if out of date

- Build image `docker build -t ride-duration-prediction-service:v1 .`
 	- -t for tag. 
- Run with `docker run -it --rm -p 9696:9696  ride-duration-prediction-service:v1`
	- --it for interactive
	- --rm means remove after
	- -p 9696:9696 - bond host port 9696 to container port 9696
	- Last is image name
