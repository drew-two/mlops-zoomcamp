# Remote Prefect Orion Deploy

## Creating EC2 instance
- Can use existing instance
- Need to open HTTP port
	- Also need 4200 for Prefect (UDP and TDP)
	- Reused VM used for Jupyter
- New conda env; install requirements
- Set UI_API_URL on VM:
	- prefect config set PREFECT_ORION_UI_API_URL="http://<external-ip>:4200/api"
	- Check current URL: prefect config view
		- If there's an issue with the URL not changing, run: prefect config unset PREFECT_ORION_UI_API_URL
		- Then try again
- Start Orion with:
	- prefect orion start --host 0.0.0.0
- Can connect with public IPV4 or AWS DNS
- In local terminal or VS code terminal, run:
	- prefect config set PREFECT_API_URL="http://<external-ip>:4200/api"

- Should now see Prefect flow runs on Prefect UI
	- Radar takes a while to load

- Cloud-agnostic given HTTP and 4200 are open

- Prefect cloud has authentication and API tokens
	- Free/local/open-source has no authentication
