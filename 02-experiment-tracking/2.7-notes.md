# MLflow: Benefits, Limitations and Alternatives

## Benefits

### Remote tracking server
The tracking server can be easily deployed to the cloud
Some benefits:
	- Share exp with other data scientists
	- Colloborate with others to build and deploy models
		- Can use model registry to easily share with ML Lead and Ops
	- Give more visiblity of the data science efforts
		- Stakeholders, manager etc can view runs and state of the models

## Issues
Issues with running a remote (shared) MLflow server
- Security
	- Restrict access to server (e.g. thru VPN only)
- Scalability
	- Check [Deploy MLflow on AWS Fargate](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-sagemaker-mlflow-fargate)
	- Check [MLflow at Company Scale](https://databricks.com/session_eu20/mlflow-at-company-scale)
- Isolation
	- Define standard for naming experiments, models and a set of default tags
		- Perhaps have name of team or product as prefix
		- Enforce certain tags that everything must have
	- Restrict access to artifacts (e.g. use S3 buckets living in different AWS accounts)
		- Don't want other teams to mess with models (perhaps production models)
		- Only teams in certain accounts (maybe by product or team) can access models

## MLflow Limitations (and when not to use it)
- Authentication & Users:
	- The open source version of MLflow doesn't provide any sort of authentication
	- No concept of users or teams
	- Paid version like DataBricks
- Data Versioning
	- To ensure full reproducibility we need to version the data used to train the model.
	- No built-in solution 
	- Workarounds:
		- Keep track of dataset path
		- Keep some hash of the files
		- If small enough, save dataset as artifact
- Model/Data Monitoring & Alerting, Finding Outliers
	- Outside scope of MLflow and other tools are more suitable
	- Can save these as experiment runs however

## Alternatives
Paid alternatives (free for individuals)
- Neptune
- Comet
- Weights & Biases

Can compare these all on neptune.ai
- Rest are cloud-based
- All have "Limited" dataset support
- MLflow cannot detect uncommitted source code changes
	- Assumes same code versions
	- Rest can see
- Cannot log multimedia or hardware consumption with MLflow
	- CPU, GPU, Memory
- MLflow integrated with most data libraries except TensorBoard, Colab, Kubeflow etc
	- Neptune only missing Kubeflow
	- Comet missing Kubeflow and XGBoost
