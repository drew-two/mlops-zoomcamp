# 2.2 Getting started with MLflow

Section is MLflow demo. See mlops-zoomcamp/02-experiment-tracking/

## Creating env

Use conda or virtualenv - good practice to make one for each project and not pollute main system packages.

VS Code - Make sure to install:
	- Python extension
	- Jupyter extension
Then choose kernel

1. $ conda create -n exp-tracking-env python=3.9
2. $ conda activate exp-tracking-env
3. See mlops-zoomcamp/02-experiment-tracking/
4. $ pip install -r requirements.txt
	a. Check this with $ pip list
5. Check mlflow CLI
6. $ mlflow ui --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mlflow.db
	a. For the model registry, create sqlite backend DB. Avoids error from 2.1
7. Open mlops-zoomcamp/02-experiment-tracking/duration-prediction.ipynb 
	a. Add models/ here as well for the models

## MLflow usage
Needs:
- mlflow.set_tracking_uri("sqlite:///mlflow.db")
	- Tracking uri - backend uri you made at launch
- mlflow.set_experiment("nyc-taxi-experiment")
	- Set experiment - create experiment or use if it exists

Recall: Used LR model, saved to ./models folder after pickeling. Lasso model did worse.
	- Many things we could update

There may be many times we train models with different parameters, but, we aren't recording these results. We may be repeating trials.
Add with mlflow.start_run():
	- Can add tags, (set_tag) like developer: drew
	- Log parameters (log_param), like train-data-path and val-data-path
	- Can log alpha
	- Can log score type (rmse)
This isn't perfect but we can look back later and realize what we were doing.

Look at mlflow ui:
	- Can see time of run 
	- No run name this time
	- User's name
	- Kernel/Python source
	- Code version
	- Model used
	- Metric used/value
Can click on time to bring experiment full screen. Can see score over time etc
