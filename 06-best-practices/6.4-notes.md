# 6.4 - Code quality: linting and formatting
- Recall: We covered code quality from the testing POV
        - Now want to talk about static analysis, like readability and best practices

- Know PEP 8 - Style guide for Python
        - How to best write code visually
        - There are things called **linters** which checks that codes file style guides and common mistakes
- Check **Pylint** for static code analysis
        - There are many linters - no specific reason to use Pylint
- Install as dev dependency (`pipenv install --dev pylint`)

- Run for specific files (`pylint model.py`) or all (`pylint --recursive=y .`)
        - Should be mostly fine

## Running/setting linter

- Back to VSCode - ctrl+shift+P > Select Linter
        - Choose Pylint
        - crtl+shift+P > Run linter
- Go to model.py
        - Should see linting in blue if set up correctly
        - Try creating .pylintrc if not working, might show up
- We don't care about all this linting. In .pylintrc, set disabled
        - missing-function-docstring,
        - missing-class-docstring,
        - missing-final-newline
- Can also create pyproject.toml in project root
        - Requires `[tool.pylint.messages_control]` at the top
        - Disable is a list (`disable = [...`)
        - VSCode can generate this

## Cleaning up for linter

- Can edit by class
	- Under class definition, ex:
		- `# pylint: disable=too-few-public-methods`
- Module docstrings can be important for developing a library
	- Not important here, get rid of it
- lambda_function.py - `def lambda_handler(event, context):`
	- `context` is not actually needed but required by AWS
	- Add `# pylint: disable=unused-argument`

- Should generally rerun pylint from command line before committing to git
	- Fails with 24 - would fail in a script pushing to git

- Can disable `"too-few-public-methods"` globally

- Too long line issue: base64 data in model_test.py
	- Easiest to save this to a file (tests/data.b64) and read it at runtime
	- Make sure to read with encoding 'utf-8' to ensure Windows compatibility 
	- It is good practice for long lines, as well as data in general, to be in separate files
- Can also set `# pylint: disable=duplicate-code` at the top of testing files with long lines

- test_docker.py: we save the Kinesis event to a file, integraton-test/event.json
	- Load this from file for testing

- There are some issues left like trailing-whitespace and imports that are just formatting. 
	- We will leave this for later

## Cleaning up formatting
- Tools for formatting python code
	- black for whitespace
	- isort for sorting import lines
- Running black with diff
	- `black --diff . | less`
- Black is very opinionated about using single-quotes.
	- Instead can set to ignore quotes (`-S` option)
- Can set configuration in pyproject.toml
	- `[tool.black]
	   line-length = 88
	   target-version = ['py39']
	   skip-string-normalization = true`
	- Now running Black without parameters will default to this

## Cleaning up imports
- Check `isort --help`
- Can run `isort --diff . | less` to see the differences
	- Tries to start with default libraries, starting with normal imports then named imports
	- Then does the same with non-standard libraries
- Alexey does not like this, tries to go by size (length of package name)
	- e.g.
		- import os
		- import sys
		- import json
		- ...
- There is an option in isort to sort by size
- Can also use pyproject.toml
	- `[tool.isort]
	   multi_line_output = 3
	   length_sort = true`

## CI/CD Project flow
0. Code
1. Run formatter (Black)
2. Run sorter (isort)
3. Run linting (pylint)
4. Run testing (pytest)

Example script
`isort .
black .
pylint --recursive==y .
pytest tests/`
