## 6.1 Integration tests with docker-compose
- Creating continuous integration testing
- Recall we factored the code for testing and made tests

- Now lambda_handler is mostly called from model.py
- Scope is limited - only tests function. Does not test whole thing together

## Testing
- Test test_docker.py (requires real test Record JSON and kinesis stream)
- Will convert this into testable function

- Can use python package deepdiff to have more detail instead of assertion statements
- Create diff object with actual_response, expected_response, and choose sig digs (1)
	- print diff
	- assert that 'type_changes' and 'values_changed" are not in diff
- Run test_docker.py from command line

- Note that returned value was a long float, and we can't know all the decimal points
	- This is why we choose sig digs for Diff, so 21.3 = 21.292390283902

- This test needs to connect to S3 to get a model.

## Updating model fetch
- Go to model.py, under get_model_location()
	- Parameterize model_bucket, experiment_id to get env variables to parameterize the model fetch
- Loading from local filesystem
	- Check if model_location from local file system exists
		- If so, return that, otherwise continue with fetching from S3
- Copy one model to s3 to model/ in integration-test/ if not there
	- Edit dockerfile to mount this folder

## Automating testing
- Script should build docker image, run it and run tests
- Make run.sh under integration-testing/
	- Make sure to cd to integration-testing/
	- Add docker build and docker run
	- If no LOCAL_IMAGE_NAME is defined
		- Can get current execution date to get latest local image (`date +"%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M"`)
		- Build LOCAL_IMAGE_NAME with date
		- Build image
	- Else don't build
	- Export `export PREDICTIONS_STREAM_NAME="ride_predictions"`
	- Run `docker-compose up -d` to run docker-compose in background, sleep 1 second
	- Want exit code to reflect failure
		- Can use `set -e` to end on first error
		- Not applicable here. Instead we can write error code to variable via `$?`
	- Check if error code is non-zero, then show docker-compose logs and bring it down
		- Exit with same error code
	- End with docker-compose down just in case

- Create docker-compose.yaml
	- Set backend with image ${LOCAL_IMAGE_NAME}
	- Set ports
	- Set environment variables from the docker run line
		- Set volume mount from same place
	-
