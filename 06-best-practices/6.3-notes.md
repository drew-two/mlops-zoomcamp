# 6.3 - Testing cloud services with LocalStack
- Recall we covered unit tests (model_test.py with pytest) and integration tests with docker (test_docker.py)
	- However, we never tested Kinesis connections

## Localstack
- A fully functional AWS cloud stack
	- May not be 100% fully functioned, but usually works pretty well
	- Can use pip or docker file
- Go back to docker-compose.yml
	- Add service `kinesis`
	- Image: localstack/localstack
	- port is 4566, map directly
	- Environment variable SERVICES=kinesis (we only need kinesis)
- Run with `docker-compose up kinesis`

- Test with AWS CLI
	- `aws kinesis list-streams`
		- However this checks AWS. Should be no streams (these cost money)
	- Add flag --endpoint-url=http://localhost:4566 kinesis`
		- `aws --endpoint-url=http://localhost:4566 kinesis list-streams`
	- Verify this by creating stream
		- `aws --endpoint-url=http://localhost:4566 kinesis create-stream --stream-name ride_predictions --shard-count 1`
- Add env variable to backend service in docker compose yaml
	- KINESIS_ENDPOINT_URL=http://kinesis:4566/

- Go to model.py, add func create_kinesis_client()
	- Get endpoint URL from env variables
		- If not set, return client with no endpoint

## Testing
- Stop container (this ends and deletes stream)
- Use run.sh to bring up docker-compose and create stream 
	- Comment below line 30 and adjust if clause)
	- Add AWS mock access key variables to kinesis service
- Check with `docker ps`, list streams
- Test and get shard iterator
	- Make sure to set env variables
		- SHARD='shardId-000000000000'
		- PREDICTIONS_STREAM_NAME="ride_predictions"
	- Use `aws --endpoint-url=http://localhost:4566 kinesis get-records --shard-iterator $SHARD_ITERATOR` after setting iterator
		- `RESULT=$(aws --endpoint-url=http://localhost:4566 kinesis get-records --shard-iterator $SHARD_ITERATOR)`
		- `echo ${RESULT} | jq -r '.Records[0].Data' | base64 --decode`
- Now how to test this automatically?

## Testing Kinesis
- Use boto3 to make script test_kinesis.py
	- Get kinesis endpoint, make sure to connect to LocalStack
	- Get stream name from env variables
	- Get shard iterator 
	- Get records from kinesis client
	- Load as JSON, decode it
	- Make sure returned response is the same as dummy request
- Lambda does this checking and decoding automatically.

## Test Automation
- Add docker-compose down and exit ${ERROR_CODE} if test_docker fails
- Repeat same code with test_kinesis.py
- Test with ./run.sh

- Works. Seems LocalStack does not give base64 encoded data. Get parse properly and exits 0
