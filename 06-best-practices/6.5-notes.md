# 6.5 - Git pre-commit hooks
- Recall: We talked about unit tests, integration tests, formatting, linting
	- We had to use 4 commands, quite a lot.
	- Could easily forget these
	- Want to always run these before committing to Git
- We can do all this easily with Git pre-commit hooks
- One example is a Python library called precommit
	- `pipenv install --dev pre-commit`

- Show in Git: go to any project and go to .git/
	- Go to folder hooks/
	- See pre-commit.sample
		- Shell script that you can run before every commit
	- ONLY a sample - need to add shell script to this folder to have Git run it every commit
- Pre-commit library helps us define the pre-commit script

## Using pre-commit
- Our Project is very big (7+ modules)
	- We could make 06-best-practices/code/ its own git repo 
	- Delete this after
- Run pre-commit
	- Fails if no pre-commit-config file
- Can run `pre-commit sample-config` to get sample config file
	- Can redirect this to file to easily edit
	- Checks for trailing whitespace, end of file, check yaml and added large files out of the box
- `pre-commit install` will add a hook to .git/hooks/
	- Can see 'pre-commit' is added to the folder

## Testing git sub project
- Note that this .git/ folder is not committed to the repo
	- Thus each person on the team must run pre-commit install (only once)
	- So, first `pre-commit install` then `pipenv install --dev`
- Add \_\_pycache\_\_/ to .gitignore
- Commit
- Note that trailing whitespace and end of files have filed
	- Even though they failed, they still fixed the files
- Run `git status` to see changed files and `git diff` to see the differences
- Re-add those files to git and make another commit
- Check with git status

## More pre-commit checks
- See link in generated pre-config yaml for possible hooks
	 - Some are interesting like 'detect-private-key'
- Now to add our formatting from the last script
- Google this and you find the way to add these. Check isort
	- Run git commit again. Should skip isort as no Python files changed.
- Add Black to pre-config yaml
	- No version set. Use the version from our Pipfile
- Can add pylint as local repo
	- Set hooks as pylint, language: system, types: [python]
	- Set args as -rn, -sn and --recursive=y
- Do same with pytest
	- Set hook name/id as pytest-check
	- pass_filenames: false
	- always_run: true
	- args: 'tests/'
- Retry git commit
	- Black could not fetch tag 'v22.6.0'
	- Should not have 'v' in front of tag (so 22.6.0) 
- pytest-check does not show anything
	- This only happens when all tests pass

## Testing specific formatters
- Remake git repo (`rm -rf .git`)
	- Then `git init`
	- Run `pre-commit install` again
	- git add and git commit again
- Should run fine. But what if we break it
	- Change indentation in lambda_function.py
	- Try adding and committing again
	- Should see some errors with Black
- Delete repo again

- Note that pylint has built-in repo support, but we just showed how to do it via command line
