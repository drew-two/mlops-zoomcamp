# 6.6 - Makefiles and make
- Linux users have this built in
- Easiest way to install on Windows is to install via **choco**

- Show dependency:
	- Create case `test` that echoes 'test'
	- Create case `run` that depends on `test` that echoes 'run'
- Make is kind of an orchestrator for a directed acyclic graph of dependencies

- Say we want to build an image, and publish to ECR
	- Before we do this, we want to run some tests
	- Add case `build` that depends on `quality_checks` `test` and `integration_test`
		- For test add `pytest tests/`
		- For integration test add `bash ./integraton-test/run.sh`
		- For quality_checks add isort, black and pylint
	- Also want to add tagging to build (get from run.sh)
	- Add case `publish` that depends on `build`
	- Make `integration_test` go after build, and make the LOCAL- variables global
	- Note that the global variables are not evaluated until use
		- Thus the dates will be off and fail if a minute passes
		- Need to assign with `:=` and add `shell` before the command in quotes	
	- Now the actual value is returned instead of command itself
	- Set `build` just to build the image
		- Set `integration_test` and call the LOCAL_IMAGE_NAME when calling the tests
			- Adjust integraton-test/run.sh to not build image if LOCAL_IMAGE_NAME is already set
	- Run `make integration_test` to check
	- Finish `publish` case the same way as `integration_test` but with scripts/publish.sh

- Features of Makefile
	- Can autocorrect with tab to finish typing case
	- Can be called from other scripts
	- Can run 'setups' (making a case that installs from Pipfile and creates pre-commit hooks)
