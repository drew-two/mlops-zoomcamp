# 6.1 Testing Python code with pytest
- Will be using the week 04 Ride prediction duration example from AWS (with Kinesis)
	- Ride events stream -> Lambda w/ model -> Predictions stream

- Get code from 04-deployment/streaming/, check 06-best-practices/code/
	- Install pipenv
	- Install pytest as dev dependency
- Configuring VS Code
	- Install Python remotely 
	- Search for Pick Python Interpreter
		- Use current env we made (pipenv --venv)
- Check the pytest is installed
	- Fails 
- Can run `PS1="> " to make shell just "> "


- Click tests -> Configure -> Choose test directory
- Create model_test.py
	- import lambda function, def test_prepare_features()
	- Get dummy ride data
	- Get actual_features from prepare_features
	- Create expected_features with the PU_DO field instead of two fields
	- Assert the two features variables are equal
- Expects to find lambda_function.py or model.py
- Run from VS Code Testing menu

## Refactoring Lambda Function
- Problems?
	- May be because lambda_function.py has a lot of global code
		- Very long function (lambda_handler)
- We will refactor this into *model.py*
	- Copy everything over
	- In lambda_function.py,
		- Create instance of model object
		- Have lambda_handler just call model_service.lambda_handler(event)
		- Keep parameters for stream name, run ID and test run
	- In model.py, create init() func using those parameters
		- Have it call a class in the same file called ModelService with lambda_handler
			- Put the old lambda_handler code here
			- Put prepare_features, predict() in here as well
			- Have init set model, model_version and callbacks
		- Back in init(), load the model via load_model (create this and have it get the model from S3)

## Testing Model
- Test; build docker. Make sure lambda_handler.py is copied into the container
	- Make sure model_init is used in lambda_handler.py
- Run test_docker.py (?) 
	- Seems to work fine
- Run model_test.py from Tests tab
	- Change dummy variable to make sure negative test

## Testing base64 result
- Create test_base64_decode();
	- Have it decode input and try and return it as a JSON ride_event
	- Make sure this is used in lambda_handler instead of directly
- Create testing func test_base64_decode()
	- Have it load dummy base64 text, decode, and make sure results match
- Create testing func test_predict()
	- Call model with None, use same dummy variable and test predict
	- Want this test to be fast and light, so we create mock model
		- Make class ModelMock, with the same methods as the actual model class
		- Have predict() just return some dummy value at init for for every row of model
	- Run test_predict() from Testing

## Cleaning
- Change prediction_event in ModelService to use model_version init variable
	- Set to None by default
	- Add callbacks=None to init variables
		- Set it to `self.callbacks = callbacks or []`
		- Sets to empty list if None
	- Iterate over all callbacks and call with prediction_event before appending in lambda_handler
- Create function def init(prediction_stream_name: str, run_id: str, test_run: bool)
	- Set callbacks = []
	- If test_run is False
		- Create kinesis client
		- Create callback and append put_record return to callbacks 
	- Create model_service and return
- Create KinesisCallback class
	- init with kinesis_client object and prediction_stream_name
	- def put_record(self, prediction_event)
		- Get ride_id and invoke self.kinesis_client.put_record

## Testing
- Create test_lambda_handler()
	- Create mock model with fake version
	- Use dummy event from the base64 data
	- Copy prediction_event from ModelService but set model_version and the ride variables (10.0, 256)
	- Assert return
