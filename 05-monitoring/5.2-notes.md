## 5.2 - Setting up the environment
- Go to 05-monitoring
- Will be using evidently service for monitoring and prediction service (the ride duration service)

- Need docker and docker-compose
- Create virtualenv or pipenv with 05-monitoring/requirements.txt 
	- Packages:
		- Werkzeug for VSGI applications
			- Used to collect data from internet
		- pyyaml for data
		- pyarrow for apache arrow
			- Well optimized and used for statistical applications
		- pymongo to connect to database
		- evidently for analytics dashboard and model behavior
- Run prepare.py to get datasets
	- Had to change URL to grab from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexeygrigorev/datasets/master/nyc-tlc/fhv/{file}

## Services Used
- Open docker-compose.yml
- Coordinates the multiple services we need to run the application
	- Can see what the main application depends on
		- Depends on mongodb and evidently, obviously
	- Can see where the services map as addresses and the ports mapped
	- Can see volumes where these get saved
	
	- Evidently service
		- Depends on config and datasets
		- Port mapping

	- Promethesus service
		- Depends on evidently and prometheus locations
		- Should always be restarted (?)	

	- Grafana service 
		- Depends on Promthesus
		- Port mapping
	
	- MongoDB
		- No dependencies
		- Port mapping
		- Volume

- Run with Docker Compose up
- Go to browser, localhost:3000 for Grafana
	- Make any account by typing stuff (used admin:admin)
